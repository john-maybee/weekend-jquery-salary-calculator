/////////////////john's project description///////////////////

We needed the site to be able to take in employee information in a table and output the monthly cost for the salary calculator. I was able to create an object that contains an employee's information and then placed the object into the array of employees that starts blank. I then added the yearly total of the salaries of the employees and divided that by 12 to get the monthly cost. 

Due to budget concerns, I made sure to turn the background red in case we go over our monthly limit of $20K. The table also allows you to delete a row/employee if there was a mistake during the logging.

Our next steps would be to refine our monthly cost field to subtract the deleted employee. Another good feature that could be used would be to add an alert pop-up when the 20K has been exceeded.
